# Exit and Rest

A music project focused on creating serene, ambient soundscapes for peace and introspection. The website acts as a minimalist, modern hub that directs users to their original compositions on platforms like YouTube and Spotify. The music itself is a blend of ambient, new age, and chillout styles, incorporating nature sounds to facilitate relaxation, meditation, sleep, and focus.
